			<h1>Overview</h1>
			<p>After a year of concerted efforts and unremitting efforts, the genetic route we designed was basically
				successful. The growth and luminescence of the algae-fungus mixture system were modeled and verified. In
				addition, we explored the future application scenarios of the product and developed improvement
				strategies to put our project into use as soon as possible.</p>

							<h1>Experiment</h1>
							<h2>1.Vibrio fischeri culture</h2>
							<p>The 2216E medium was used to recover Vibrio fischeri lyophilized powder. The medium
								inoculated with Vibrio fischeri was incubated at 22℃ for 48h, and the luminescence test
								was carried out using a multifunctional microplate reader after observing the turbidity
								of the medium and the blue fluorescence in the darkness with the naked eye.</p>

							<p>We successfully cultured Vibrio fischeri in the lab and observed bioluminescence.
								However, because of the slow growth rate and the time required for luminescence, we did
								not consider Vibrio fischeri to be suitable as our chassis bacteria, and its
								luminescence principle inspired us to explore further.</p>



							<h2>2.Envz-OmpR Validating of the Two-component osmotic pressure sensing system Envz-OmpR
							</h2>
							<p>Validation experiments were performed with BL21(DE3). LB medium with different NaCl
								concentrations was prepared and reporter gene expression was observed.</p>

							<h2>3.Validating luminescence efficacy of Lux gene clusters</h2>
							<p>The Lux gene cluster (LuxCDABE or LuxCDABEGF) was introduced into BL21 (DE3) and
								expression was induced using IPTG. Bioluminescence was observed by naked eye and
								photographed. After the obvious luminescence was observed by naked eyes, the
								fluorescence intensity was quantified using a multifunctional microplate reader.</p>

							<h2>4.Validating cold-tolerant module protein expression</h2>
							<p>Plasmids containing proteins encoding SOD and Catalase were introduced into BL21 (DE3) and expression was induced using 0.5 mM and 0 mM IPTG, respectively, and SDS-PAGE was performed to verify protein expression.</p>

							<h2>5.Preparation and recovery of lyophilized bacterial powder:</h2>
							<p>BL21 (DE3) was lyophilized using liquid LB medium with 10% sucrose as a protective agent. After one week of lyophilization and preservation, the plates were resuscitated using liquid LB medium, diluted 3,000-fold, coated and cultured in microtiter plates. The coated plates and culture results were visualized.</p>

							<h2>6.Verificating radiation resistance of RecO, RecF</h2>
							<p>Plasmids containing genes encoding RecO and RecF were introduced into BL21 (DE3), diluted coated plates (agar plates containing IPTG) were irradiated with different doses of UV light, and surviving colonies were counted after 3 days of incubation. Protein expression was induced with 1 mM IPTG and SDS-PAGE was performed to verify protein expression.</p>

							<h1>Product design and future plans</h1>
							
							<p>Based on the algal bacterial system, we have designed fluorescent positioning life jackets, parachutes and space suits to adapt to different application scenarios. </p>
							<p>①Fluorescent positioning life jacket: In case of shipwreck or emergency, the fluorescent positioning life jacket can quickly respond to environmental changes, and the built-in freeze-dried bacterial powder package emits blue fluorescence when activated by water, significantly improving the rescue positioning efficiency and earning valuable survival time for those in distress. </p>
							<p>②Fluorescent positioning parachute: When the aircraft or helicopter is forced to land on the sea for some reason, the biological coating integrated on the surface of the fluorescent positioning parachute can be activated and emit blue fluorescence after encountering water, providing accurate positioning for search and rescue operations.</p>
							<p>③Ecological rescue spacesuit: When operating on the surface of a planet or performing a mission in the event of an accident, the ecological rescue spacesuit can emit bright fluorescent signals for search and rescue, while its miniature ecosystem can continue to provide astronauts with oxygen and nutrients needed for life, greatly extending the survival time of astronauts, adding a new dimension of safety to space exploration.</p>

							<br><br>

							<p>In fact, LuminAid is used in a wide range of applications. Our initial aim was to apply this technology to spacesuits, so as to make up for some of the shortcomings of existing bionic lighting technology, reduce the energy dependence on the earth, and achieve in-situ and sustainable use of energy; It can also be equipped to the outside of the rescue chamber as a kind of identification mark. At the same time, the new technologies applied in space exploration can often feed back to the earth, providing new focus for the development of earth science and technology. We focused on tapping into the huge potential of LuminAid in terraforming and designed it to be equipped with life jackets, parachutes, and various rescue scenarios.</p>

							<h2 id="Space">1. Space</h2>
							<h3>(1)Spacesuit</h3>
							<p>Deep space exploration missions, planetary surface surveys, long-term spacewalks: In deep space areas far away from Earth and communication signals may be interrupted, if astronauts encounter accidental loss of contact, LuminAid equipped on the spacesuit will become a rescue beacon for rescuers, providing emergency positioning functions.</p>

							<h3>(2)Parachute</h3>
							<p>Maritime Disaster Rescue: When an airplane or helicopter is forced to land on the sea surface for some reason, passengers and crew can use this parachute to escape urgently. The fluorescent effect of the parachute surface when it encounters water can quickly attract the attention of search and rescue personnel and shorten the rescue time.</p>
