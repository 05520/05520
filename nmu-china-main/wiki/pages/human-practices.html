										<p>Q1: We learnt that the Northwestern Polytechnical University has researched a cyanobacterium that can secrete sucrose to the outside of the cell, what is the principle of sucrose secretion by this cyanobacterium? What is the efficiency of sucrose secretion?</p>
										<p>A1: The principle is to establish a gene editing system of Cyanobacteria through the transformation technology of exogenous DNA of Cyanobacteria, which provides a strong technical support for the construction of cyanobacterial artificial leaves. Through gene editing of Cyanobacteria, we successfully obtained Cyanobacteria that can automatically excrete cell-produced sucrose outside the cell. Regarding the efficiency of sucrose secretion, we conducted experiments and found that, with the continuous cultivation of the Cyanobacteria, the wild-type cyanobacteria basically remained unchanged, while the experimental group of Cyanobacteria continued to produce sucrose to the extracellular area, and the cumulative sucrose concentration in the extracellular cultivation solution was able to reach more than 1.1G/L. </p>
										<p>Q2: Synechococcus is one of the major representative groups of marine Cyanobacteria, which is widely distributed in the world's oceans. In our project, we are going to construct a symbiotic system of Vibrio natriegens and Synechococcus to provide nutrients for Vibrio natriegens and fluorescence for Vibrio natriegens to provide illumination. What is your suggestion on the ability of Synechococcus to secrete sucrose?</p>
										<p>A2: The secretion of sucrose by Synechococcus is essentially a function of photosynthesis, so maybe we can start from light. You provide light for algae to photosynthesise through the blue fluorescence emitted by the strain, and blue light is more favourable to the growth of algae than white light, so maybe we can start from the genetic modification of your target strain, so as to make the strain emit a stronger and more stable blue fluorescence, which may improve the ability of sucrose secretion by the bacteria. improve the ability of Synechococcus to secrete sucrose. And to make the sucrose secreted by Synechococcus supplied for human use, perhaps we can refer to our genetic line modification of Cyanobacteria - heterologous expression of proton and sucrose co-transporter protein (cscB), which has successfully achieved efficient production of sucrose from Cyanobacteria without interfering with cell growth. </p>
										<p>Q3: We hope that our algae-bacteria coexistence system can have more application scenarios in a wider range of aspects, what do you think about the prospect of our project? What do you think are the possible application scenarios? </p>
										<p>A3: The core of your algae-bacteria system is the autotrophic and luminescence ability, which can be applied in any scenario that needs lighting, and the application prospect is very wide. Moreover, photosynthesis also produces oxygen, which may be applied in any scenario that requires oxygen supply.</p>

										<p>Q1: Dear Professor Zhang. We plan to design an algae bacteria symbiotic system that can provide energy and emit fluorescence for astronauts. But we understand that there is a large amount of radiation in the space environment, which may cause damage to engineering bacteria and affect product functionality. Is there any method to assist engineering bacteria in resisting radiation?</p>
										<p>A1: Most organisms are highly sensitive to radiation, and radiation doses exceeding 5Gy can cause serious consequences to the organism. In general, radiation protection mainly includes three types: time protection, distance protection, and barrier protection. You can consider these three methods comprehensively.</p>
										<p>Q2: Okay, we have learned about the general methods of radiation protection, so is it possible to use synthetic biology methods to solve the radiation problem?</p>
										<p>A2: Some organisms in nature have the ability to tolerate a certain amount of radiation. For example, there is a soil microorganism called Deinococcus Radiodurans that can tolerate chronic ionizing radiation exceeding 60 Gy/h. It mainly resists radiation damage through an efficient DNA damage repair system and antioxidant capacity. You can seek inspiration from existing organisms in nature to improve your own projects.</p>
										<p>Q3: Thank you Professor Zhang for your valuable feedback. We will improve the radiation resistance of engineering bacteria based on your suggestions.</p>

										<p>Q1: Dear Professor Zhao Junlong, we have developed an aluminum bacterial coexistence system that can be applied to achieve luminescence localization in the ocean. We hope that the fluorescence emitted by engineering bacteria can be stronger. Do you have any improvement suggestions for this?</p>
										<p>A: In general, increasing the luminescence intensity of engineered bacteria can be achieved by increasing substrate accumulation, but this is not the only way. In the marine environment, there are naturally many luminescent organisms. Expanding the fluorescence intensity and area requires the use of marine native luminescent bacteria, and cannot rely solely on the proliferation and luminescence of engineered bacteria.</p>
										<p>Q2: In the previous project process, we learned that Vibrio fischeri is a luminescent bacterium that exists in the ocean. If we want to enhance the luminescence intensity with Vibrio fischeri, what are the feasible methods?</p>
										<p>A: Vibrio fischeri are common bacteria in the ocean that can sense changes in chemicals in their surrounding environment and respond through chemotactic movements that help them find nutrient rich areas or avoid harmful substances. Perhaps you can use this to achieve your goal.</p>

										<p>Q1: Hello Professor He. We plan to design a Synechococcus-Vibrio natriegens coexistence system that adapts to multiple scenarios through self-sustaining luminescence. Do you think there is anything that can be improved?</p>
										<p>A: I have reviewed your project and think the overall concept is quite good. But I think your application in the ocean still has flaws. For example, if luminescent bacteria float to other places or leak out, you cannot accurately locate the person who fell into the water, resulting in false positives.</p>
										<p>Q2: Thank you for Professor He's valuable feedback. So, what do you think are the possible directions to solve this problem?</p>
										<p>A: Since the issue of false positives may be caused by the migration or leakage of luminescent bacteria, you can focus on these two aspects. Bacterial drifting can be solved by improving materials, carriers, and other methods. Leakage can add suicide genes to prevent bacteria from surviving outside the fixed range.</p>
										<p>Q3: Thank you for your suggestion, we will make improvements based on it.</p>

										<p>Q: Mr. Fan, thank you very much for agreeing to this interview. As a chief engineer with 46 years of maritime experience, you must have accumulated extensive knowledge regarding safety at sea. In your opinion, what is the greatest challenge currently facing maritime rescue operations?</p>
										<p>A: The most significant challenge in maritime rescue undoubtedly lies in visibility issues, particularly during nighttime or adverse weather conditions. Waves and fog can severely reduce search and rescue efficiency and increase operational difficulty. Additionally, the vastness of the ocean means that once someone falls overboard, locating them becomes especially challenging.</p>
										<p>Q: Indeed, visibility is a key factor affecting maritime safety. We have developed a bioluminescent product, life jackets, that glow all over to enhance visibility. What are your thoughts on this?</p>
										<p>A: This is an excellent idea. For instance, if someone were to fall overboard at night and a spotlight shines on them, the large illuminated area would reflect light effectively; it would be immediately noticeable—acting like a "flashlight" at sea.</p>
										<p>Q: Thank you for your endorsement! How do you believe it could contribute to improving rescue efficiency?</p>
										<p>A: The design of this life jacket is quite ingenious; its full-body luminescence significantly enhances the visibility of individuals who have fallen into the water. As you mentioned earlier, if someone goes overboard at night and they are illuminated by a spotlight—the large glowing area reflects strong light—rescue personnel can quickly identify their location, greatly reducing response time. This not only improves rescue efficiency but also increases survival chances for those in distress.</p>
										<p>Q: Regarding luminescent colors, we currently offer blue and white options. Do you see any particular advantages or disadvantages between these two colors in practical applications? Or do you have other color suggestions?</p>
										<p>A: I think both blue and white are good choices; it ultimately depends on the usage scenario. For example, blue may stand out more against dark waters at night while white might be easier to recognize during daylight or well-lit conditions. However, what matters most to me is that the luminescence is effective enough to clearly indicate the position of anyone who has fallen overboard so that rescuers can easily spot them. There’s no absolute preference regarding color; practicality should take precedence.</p>
										<p>Q: Beyond enhancing visibility, what other potential advantages or areas for improvement do you see for this bioluminescent life jacket?</p>
										<p>A: I believe this life jacket already performs admirably; however, further enhancements in durability and waterproofing would make it even better since marine environments can be complex and unpredictable—it needs to withstand various challenges effectively. Additionally, integrating emergency signaling devices such as automatic illumination or audible distress signals into the life jacket would further enhance its functionality.</p>
										<p>Q: Thank you very much for your valuable insights today; they will greatly assist us in our ongoing product development efforts! Lastly，do you have any words of advice for maritime workers or young individuals embarking on careers at sea? </p>
										<p>A: I want to emphasize that working at sea presents numerous challenges but also offers immense fulfillment. Safety must always come first. I hope everyone remains vigilant and adheres strictly to safety protocols while continuously learning new skills and technologies to improve their professional competence as well as their ability to respond effectively in emergencies. Only then can we navigate safely through the vast oceans ahead!</p>

			<p><b>Carl Sagan</b> once said that <b>the Earth is the cradle of humanity, but mankind cannot stay in the
					cradle forever.</b>
				As problems such as climate change, overpopulation and resource depletion become more and more
				prominent, the need for human beings to explore space is gradually increasing. At the same time, new
				technologies applied in space exploration can often be fed back to the Earth, providing a new focus
				point for the development of science and technology on Earth. <b>While focusing on space, our team also

								<strong>Figure. 2 | NASA Z-2 spacesuit</strong>

						</div>
						<p>In 2014, NASA unveiled the Z-2 spacesuit, which creatively employs bionic technology
							inspired by oceanic glowing creatures to provide illumination in dimmer environments.
							However, we learnt that the suit's luminous intensity was very limited and relied on
							bulky life-support systems, restricting the astronauts' flexibility.</p>
						<p>Inspired by the Z-2 spacesuit, our team decided to apply synthetic biology principles to
							design a life support system that combines life support, in situ resource utilization,
							luminescent illumination, and instant communication.</p>
						<p>In the practical work stage, we carried out social practices, interviewed different
							stakeholders and recorded their feedback. Then, we closed the loop by consciously
							improving all aspects of the project based on stakeholders' feedback.</p>
						<p>Prior to the commencement of the formal project, we gained a broad understanding of
							existing technologies and difficulties, reviewed relevant regulations and policies, and
							determined the initial feasibility of the project. During the initial stages of the
							project, we conducted broad brainstorm and reviewed the luminescent organisms present
							in nature, noting the presence of a microorganism called Vibrio fischeri in the ocean.
							Vibrio fischeri is a heterotrophic Gram-negative bacterium that often co-exists with
							marine organisms such as squid and can emit blue fluorescence. However, the fluorescence
							of Vibrio fischeri is not stable and intense enough to meet our luminescence
							requirements. More importantly, Vibrio fischeri is closely related to Vibrio cholera and
							other pathogens, making it potentially dangerous to humans. </p>
						<p>In view of the shortcomings of Vibrio fischeri, our team found a non-pathogenic
							bacterium, Vibrio natriegens, as a chassis, into which the Lux gene cluster was
							transferred to achieve stable and intense bioluminescence. In order to address the
							nutritional requirements of Vibrio natriegens, we hope to construct a Synechococcus-
							Vibrio natriegens coexistence system and utilize the photosynthetic autotrophic ability
							of Synechococcus to achieve in situ resource utilization.</p>

						<h1>Project initial design</h1>
						<p><b>Situation:</b> We have identified the basic structure of the algal-bacterial coexistence
							system, but we have encountered a new problem - most of the organic matter produced by
							photosynthesis of Synechococcus is used for its own growth and reproduction, which is
							difficult to be utilized by Vibrio natriegens.</p>
						<p><b>Target:</b> In order to make the organic matter produced by Synechococcus more fully utilized
							by Vibrio natriegens, we interviewed Dr. Fei Hao from Northwestern Polytechnical
							University, hoping to provide new ideas for our engineering bacteria design. </p>
						<p><b>Feedback:</b> Through gene editing of Cyanobacteria, it is possible to obtain Cyanobacteria
							that can automatically excrete cell-produced sucrose outside the cell. Synechococcus, a
							major group of Cyanobacteria, can also be modified using gene editing technology. </p>
						<p><b>Close the loop:</b> We plan to carry out our own experiments to introduce the cscB gene to
							achieve efficient production and secretion of sucrose to satisfy the nutrient needs of
							sodium-demanding Vibrio natriegens, using Synechococcus as a chassis organism.</p>
						<br>

						<p>Cyanobacteria secreting sucrose extracellularly can be obtained by establishing a
							cyanobacterial gene editing system through exogenous DNA transformation technology and
							transferring heterologous expression of proton and sucrose cotransporter protein (cscB)
							into Cyanobacteria. The modified Cyanobacteria can continuously produce sucrose
							extracellularly, and the cumulative concentration of sucrose in the extracellular
							culture medium can reach 1.1 g/L. Synechococcus is a major representative group of

						<p>In order to further understand the public's views and attitudes towards space immigration, we distributed questionnaires to the public and collected a total of 476. Surprisingly, most people were more enthusiastic about space migration than we thought. The positive results of the questionnaire gave us a lot of positive feedback, despite the fact that a large part of the group that received our questionnaire were young people, who are more imaginative about the future. The enthusiasm for space migration shows the dynamism of the endeavor, and despite the difficulties that still lie ahead, mankind's determination and perseverance will make the dream a reality!</p>

						<h3>(2)Define application scenarios</h3>
						<p>In order to clarify our application scenarios, we discussed with Liu Liwei, an aeronautics major. After the interview, we learned that there are many planets in the solar system that have been found to have the potential for biological survival - Titan, Venus, Titan II, Mars and so on. Considering the low temperatures, lack of oxygen, and water resources, Mars is currently the most desirable choice in our solar system. Therefore, we have finally decided to use Mars as a specific application scenario for our chassis microbes in order to modify our chassis microbes in a targeted manner.</p>

						<p><b>Situation:</b> In recent years, with the growth of global demand for maritime transport and the increase in maritime activities, the frequent occurrence of maritime accidents has attracted widespread attention. </p>
						<p><b>Target:</b> In order to have a preliminary understanding of the current situation of maritime accidents, we launched a relevant research to facilitate our follow-up work. Methods: Based on the data published by the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) and the China Maritime Search and Rescue Centre (CMSRC) of the Ministry of Safety and Transport of China, we gained a preliminary understanding of the frequency of maritime accidents over the years.</p>
						<p><b>Feedback:</b> According to the data released by China's Maritime Search and Rescue Centre, although the current rescue effect is remarkable, reaching an average success rate of 96.32%, there are still cases of no survivors. The visual obstruction at night and the harsh marine environment are also important factors contributing to the high number of accidents at sea and the short survival time of people who fall into the water. </p>
						<p><b>Close the loop:</b> these data show the great application value of our project, and the ability to accurately locate the position of a person in distress in a short period of time is crucial to maritime rescue efforts.</p>

						<p><b>Target:</b> We have communicated with Professor He Jin, an expert in synthetic biology, and hope to receive valuable opinions and suggestions from Professor He to make our approach more feasible.</p>
						<p><b>Feedback:</b> Professor He Jin raised the issue of false positives to us - engineering bacteria may be located incorrectly due to drift or biological leakage, and provided us with improvement suggestions.</p>
						<p><b>Closed loop:</b> Considering Professor He Jin's proposal, we should not only improve the materials used for attaching engineering bacteria to prevent them from escaping. At the same time, improving the suicide program of fugitive bacteria at the genetic level can reduce the possibility of false positives from two aspects.</p>

						<h3>(3)Ocean snow problem-airbag protein</h3>
						<p>We have constructed a coexistence system of algae and bacteria, in which cyanobacteria can produce their own vesicle proteins, but Vibrio natriegens cannot float and aggregate. However, we found that it may not float on the sea surface as expected, forming a structure similar to "ocean snow" and undergoing sedimentation. We refer to the gene pathway of blue-green algae producing airbag proteins and introduce the gene pathway of airbag proteins into Vibrio natriegens, allowing them to produce airbag proteins on their own. This can help the development of the algal bacterial system, increase the luminous area, and facilitate the development of the product's positioning and rescue functions.</p>

						<h1>Practical research and Product design</h1>
						<p>After engaging in discussions with experts across various fields, we gained a more comprehensive understanding of our project and identified specific areas for improvement. Leveraging their feedback and insights, we refined the design of our route. With the objective of developing practical products that can ultimately yield significant impact in the fields of oceanic and space exploration, we are currently focused on further optimizing our designs.</p>

						<h2 id="five1">1. Initial product design</h2>
						<p>In the expansive oceanic environment, the rescue of individuals who have fallen overboard presents significant challenges, particularly during nighttime when visibility is markedly reduced and the effective range of light for search and rescue operations is severely constrained. However, if we could establish a bioluminescent fluorescent sea populated with bacteria around the individual in distress, it would substantially enhance nighttime search efficiency. </p>
						<p>To this end, our initial design for marine products features a membrane-encased folding package. Our objective is to optimize the actual luminescent surface area of our product while mitigating the risk of bacterial leakage in accordance with current technological advancements. We are committed to maximizing the deployed area while ensuring robust prevention against any potential bacterial leakage.</p>


						<h2 id="five2">2. Product design refinement</h2>
						<h3>(1) Comprehension of material characteristics</h3>
						<p id="aa1">In light of the limitations inherent in our original folding package design, we engaged in discussions with Hu Shuoyi, a student specializing in materials science at Westlake University. </p>
						<div style="float:left;display: flex;flex-direction: column;width: 25%;margin: 0 5px;">
							<img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5210/hp-40.png" style="width:100%;height: 100%;float:left;">

						</div>
						<p>Our objective was to identify an ideal material that is both easily foldable and possesses effective antibacterial filtration properties. Through comprehensive analysis, we recognized the constraints of physical folding mechanisms alongside the challenges posed by chemically expanding materials. Ultimately, we established a reasonable deployment area of approximately several dozen square meters to ensure a significant enhancement in maritime search and rescue efficiency under bioluminescent conditions.</p>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>

						<p></p><br><br><br>
						<h3>(2) Expansion of the user demographic and enhancement of product efficacy</h3>
						<p>Simultaneously, recognizing a broader spectrum of potential users—including commercial shipping companies, fishing vessels, government and maritime rescue agencies, recreational yacht passengers, cruise ship travelers, and water sports enthusiasts—we shifted our focus towards the design concept of "bioluminescent life jackets." This approach allowed us to relax the requirements for material folding performance while enhancing the product's practicality and feasibility. Furthermore, building on insights gained from our previous interview with Professor Wu Minjuan, we aim to improve the thermal insulation and corrosion resistance properties of our materials. This enhancement will enable our product not only to assist efficiently in search and rescue positioning but also to provide effective protection against seawater immersion damage. Consequently, this comprehensive strategy aims to significantly elevate the success rate of marine rescues. These adjustments and upgrades are grounded in a deeper understanding and validation of the product's application scenarios.</p>

						<h3>(3) Improve product performance</h3>
						<p><b>Situation:</b>In order to cope with the complexity of the marine environment and the high standard of life-saving devices, we focus on material selection and product design optimisation. We need to understand the special characteristics of the marine and space environments and improve the products to make them more suitable for marine and space applications.</p>
						<p><b>Target:</b>Seawater is characterised by low temperature, high salt, high osmosis and high bacterial content, which determines the special pathophysiological changes of trauma combined with seawater immersion. In order to avoid the problems of dehydration and infection, we plan to interview Prof Wu Minjuan, whose research focuses on marine wound repair. The space environment is more extreme, with astronauts facing strong radiation, dryness and temperature. We plan to do a summary survey of the different materials after the interview with Mr Beard.</p>
						<p><b>Feedback:</b>Professor Wu mentioned that electrostatic spinning technology could be considered. Electrostatic spinning is a technique of spinning polymer solutions under high voltage electrostatic force, which produces a material that is not easily damaged and has good air permeability, thus reducing the effects of seawater hypertonicity and the presence of bacteria. In addition, electrostatic spinning can be combined with a variety of materials to achieve strong compatibility.</p>

						<p>Upon comparison, we found that wound dressings based on electrostatic spinning technology have the advantage of large specific surface area and large pore size, which in turn accelerates wound healing and attachment of engineered bacteria, and hinders the occurrence of bacterial infection and dehydration.</p>
						<p>The small pore size and selective permeability of biofilms, as well as the similarity of the membrane structure to the extracellular matrix, facilitates cell adhesion, proliferation and differentiation, and can withstand extreme environments, making them suitable for use in the space environment. </p>
						<p><b>Close the loop:</b> In response to the risks of dehydration and infection associated with prolonged immersion in seawater, we have improved life-saving equipment for the marine environment. Instead of the membrane structure that was initially fitted alongside the lifejacket, we have used an electrostatically spun nanofibre membrane, with an outer layer of algae+bacteria coating and an inner layer of fabric, which glows once it has been exposed to water, and glows when it has been exposed to water. While in the space environment, we use biofilm technology to replace the inner layer of material with selective permeability and protective biofilm, which not only adapts to the extreme conditions, but also facilitates the survival and attachment of engineered bacteria.</p>



						<h2 id="five3">3. First-ever Space Meet-Up</h2>
						<p><b>Situition:</b> We were honored to participate in the first-ever Space Meet-Up, where various teams presented and shared insights about their projects. We gained a wealth of knowledge and engaged in open discussions and Q&A sessions, allowing for in-depth exchanges with experts within the space network. </p>
						<p><b>Target:</b> During these interactions, HQ Lucus Boldrini highlighted the complexities of space logistics, prompting us to recognize that addressing issues related to space requires careful consideration of the challenges inherent in this field. </p>
						<p><b>Feedback:</b> Subsequently, through research and discussion, we identified several key technological challenges facing space logistics: ensuring long-term stable storage of materials and cargo in a space environment; safeguarding their safety and integrity under extreme conditions; and achieving high precision and reliability in navigation and positioning. Notably, when it comes to transporting living organisms, it is imperative to meticulously select appropriate transport vehicles to maximize the survival chances of biological entities during their journey through space.</p>
						<p><b>Close the loop:</b> In light of the aforementioned considerations, we have placed particular emphasis on reducing logistics costs while enhancing the product's lightweight nature, stability, and long-term preservation capabilities. After extensive experimentation and evaluation, we ultimately selected freeze-dried powder preservation as the core technology for our products. This choice not only significantly reduces the weight of the product but also enhances its stability in space environments, facilitating transportation while maintaining long-term viability. Through rigorous validation via wet group experiments, we ensured both the feasibility and effectiveness of this technology.</p>
						<p>Building upon these improvements, we designed three innovative products that integrate specific requirements from their respective scenarios with our technological advancements. These products are aimed at providing robust support for future maritime operations and space exploration endeavors.</p>

						<h1>Public Evaluation</h1>
						<p></p>
						<p id="bb1"><b>Situation:</b>Before a product can be brought to market, it is essential to conduct thorough research on the target demographic. Our bioluminescent life jackets, developed for use in nighttime search and rescue operations for individuals who have fallen overboard, prompted us to reach out to Mr. Fan, the chief engineer of a ferry service at the shipping center. We sought his insights regarding the feasibility of our product.</p>
					
						<p><b>Target:</b>By focusing on the intended user group, we aimed to gather valuable feedback on their perceptions of our product, encompassing both its advantages and disadvantages. This information will assist us in further optimizing product performance and establishing a solid foundation for future production efforts.</p>
				
						<p><b>Feedback:</b>Mr. Fan provided high praise for our bioluminescent life jacket product. Drawing on his extensive experience in maritime search and rescue, he highlighted that locating individuals who have fallen overboard during nighttime operations poses a significant challenge. He noted that our product's large surface area of luminescence significantly enhances visibility under spotlight illumination, effectively serving as a "flashlight at sea," which greatly facilitates rescue efforts.</p>
						<p>Additionally, Mr. Fan offered valuable suggestions for improvement. He recommended that we enhance the waterproofing and durability of the product while maintaining its existing advantages to better withstand the complexities of marine environments. Furthermore, he proposed incorporating an emergency sound signaling device to assist with location identification through auditory cues, thereby adding an extra layer of assurance to the rescue process and making the product more comprehensive.</p>
						<p>In conclusion, Mr. Fan expressed great optimism for maritime workers and encouraged them to embrace new products and technologies actively while continuously improving their capabilities in responding to emergencies, collectively safeguarding ocean safety.</p>

						<h1>Explore the future</h1>
						<p>Due to the "luminescence" initiative and the similarities between mining, polar, deep-sea environments, and space—each of which heavily relies on oxygen and light—we envision that this space-derived product could ultimately be adapted for use on Earth. It may serve applications in terrestrial, polar, and marine geological exploration, life support systems, extreme sports, and potentially reveal new value in fields such as biomedical science and optical communication.</p>

						<h1>Integrating Human Practice with Education and Communication</h1>

						<h2>1.Inter-school Cooperation</h2>
						<p>Inter-school collaborations have played a crucial role in our iGEM project cycle throughout the iGEM cycle, and we have established links with many schools, informing and popularising synthetic biology and our project to them. Accordingly, these schools provided us with many useful suggestions. This has not only deepened our understanding of synthetic biology, but also greatly broadened our horizons and resource network. Through active interactions and exchanges, we have established deep ties with many domestic and international universities to promote the popularisation of synthetic biology knowledge and project innovation. <a href="https://2024.igem.wiki/nmu-china/collaboration" style="color: #027efb;">(You will find more details on our Collaboration page)</a></p>
						
						<h2>2.Public Education</h2>
						<p>In order to popularise synthetic biology to the public in a comprehensive and in-depth manner, we have carried out a wide range of work. We actively carry out synthetic biology activities on campus to stimulate students' interest and curiosity in this field. Through the advantage of new media platforms, we have launched a series of synthetic biology popularisation videos to provide a convenient way for interested people to learn about synthetic biology, and introduced the public to the correct way of self-rescue in the event of drowning through the production of pamphlets and the publication of popular science articles. We also invite people of different ages to the lab for fun activities to let them experience the beauty of synthetic biology. We also promote synthetic biology by communicating with different teams and participating in synthetic biology art exhibitions to include team members from different backgrounds. <a href="https://2024.igem.wiki/nmu-china/education" style="color: #027efb;">(You will find more details on our Education page)</a></p>
