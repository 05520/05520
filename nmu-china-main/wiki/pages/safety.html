            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p id="dd1">Working safely and securely is a core element of responsible research and innovation. NMU_China always
                puts safety and security in the first place, and we always keep the importance of safety in mind during
                the promotion and improvement of the project.</p>
            <p>We keep in mind that <b>"Being transparent about possible risks and how we manage them is a key component
                    of being a responsible scientist or engineer."</b>. In our laboratory work, we always insist on
                standardized operations and the highest safety standards, even for the simplest experiments. It is worth
                noting that our projects have applications in the Earth's oceans and in space, and for different
                scenarios we have designed safety modules to maximize the feasibility of our projects and the safety of
                our users. In addition, we promote the importance of safety in human practice, comply with relevant laws
                and regulations, and analyze policies.</p>

Our overview of safety efforts in space gives a good reference for teams who want to participate in the Space Village and serves as a catalyst for the application of synthetic biology in space, beyond the competition itself.</td>

                                <p>1. Ensure that wastes such as media in the laboratory are autoclaved and do not
                                    contaminate the environment. The storage of waste liquids should be sealed by
                                    choosing suitable containers and storage places, and stored in well ventilated
                                    places.</p>
                                <p>2. Wastes should be collected and stored in a reasonable manner according to its

                                    hazardous wastes and making handover records (including the type, quantity,
                                    characteristics and type of packaging containers of laboratory hazardous wastes,
                                    and the date of on-campus transfer, etc.).

                                <p>3. Wastes will be reconfirmed as non-toxic and non-hazardous prior to disposal to
                                    safeguard the environment and personnel. Regular self-inspection will be
                                    conducted on the sealing, breakage and leakage of storage containers, labelling,
                                    and storage period.

                                <p>4. All containers, infectious substances and wastes are clearly labelled and
                                    properly stored in designated locations. Laboratory wastes are centrally
                                    collected and treated by physical or chemical methods depending on the nature of
                                    the wastes. Waste materials that are not disposed of in a timely manner are
                                    stored in special waste collection bins and labelled accordingly.</p>
                                <p>5. Equipment is cleaned, maintained and repaired on a regular basis, and once
                                    equipment malfunctions are detected, a thorough cleaning and sterilisation
                                    process is carried out immediately to ensure a hygienic and safe laboratory

                                <p>In order to standardise the process of experimental operations and ensure
                                    personal safety, we observe the following safety principles:</p>
                                <p>1. Designate special experimental areas in the laboratory and mark different
                                    kinds of reagents according to regulations (Photo 1).</p>
                                <p>2. Make emergency plans for accidents such as chemical leakage, fire, theft and
                                    earthquake, and inform the relevant person in charge of the situation (Photo 2).
                                </p>
                                <p>3. Follow established norms when performing experimental operations in the
                                    laboratory. All equipment needs to be maintained regularly, turned off promptly
                                    after use and reagents need to be replaced promptly if necessary (Photo 2).
                                </p>
                                <p>4. Observe the rules and regulations for the procurement, storage and use of
                                    chemicals(Photo 2).</p>
                                <p>5. The laboratory must have sound waste disposal methods. Wastes such as
                                    discarded aspiration reagent tips should be disposed of in a designated manner,
                                    and hazardous substances should be disposed of separately in a special bin(Photo
                                    2).</p>
                                <p>6. Ensure that each member knows the evacuation channel and is familiar with the
                                    escape route(Photo 3).</p>
                                <p>7. Abide by the prohibited signs, prohibit littering, prohibit food and drink
                                    during the experiment, and pay attention to no fireworks(Photo 3).</p>
                                <p>8. It is strictly prohibited to increase high-power electrical appliances without
                                    permission. Do not leave when conducting high temperature and high pressure
                                    experiments. Secret-related experimental projects shall be incorporated into the
                                    confidentiality management channels, and the confidentiality responsibility
                                    system shall be strictly implemented(Photo 3).</p>

                                    courses and tests including basic experimental skills, laboratory cleaning,
                                    waste disposal, code of ethics, chemicals storage, laboratory rules, equipment
                                    safety and emergency plans. In addition, during the course of our experiments,
                                    it is essential to have at least one experienced lecturer present who will
                                    provide the necessary guidance and ensure that the experimental process is
                                    carried out safely.</p>

                                <p>The basic laboratory skills training covers a range of specific laboratory
                                    techniques, including plasmid extraction, RNA extraction, agarose gel
                                    electrophoresis and so on. Laboratory safety precautions include not only
                                    careful documentation of instrument use and accurate labelling of samples, but
                                    also strict adherence to waste disposal practices (See <a href="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5210/pdf/safety-of-common-equipment-and-chemicals.pdf" style="color: #027efb;">Safety of

                                    instructors introduced emergency evacuation routes and taught how to use first
                                    aid kits, fire-fighting equipment and the related emergency plan for laboratory
                                    safety accidents(See <a href="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5210/pdf/emergency-plan-for-laboratory-accidents.pdf" style="color: #027efb;">Emergency plan for laboratory

                                <p>In addition to laboratory skills training, each member is actively involved in
                                    learning personal protection and strictly following laboratory protocols to
                                    minimize potential hazards. Personal protection training is outlined below:</p>
                                <p><b>Dressing:</b> In a laboratory setting, lab coats should be covered to the
                                    knees and sleeves should be wrapped around the wrists to protect the skin and
                                    personal clothing from direct contact with hazardous substances. Be sure to wear
                                    a standard long-sleeved lab coat, long pants, gloves and a mask to ensure that
                                    your hair is properly restrained, and it is strictly forbidden to wear any
                                    jewelry that may affect the safety of the experiment. Shoes should cover the
                                    feet completely and high heels or slippers should not be chosen. </p>
                                <p><b>Cleanliness:</b> Hands must be washed after gloves are removed and before
                                    leaving the laboratory. If visible contamination of hands occurs while removing
                                    the PPE, wash your hands before proceeding to remove other PPE. Wash your hands
                                    with soap and water or use alcohol. In addition to routine cleaning and
                                    disinfection measures, the performance of clean benches needs to be regularly
                                    tested and evaluated.</p>
                                <p><b>Equipment usage:</b></p>
                                <p>(1) Before use, carefully check whether the various conditions meet the
                                    requirements and whether there is any abnormality; In use, pay attention to
                                    observe whether the various states of the instrument are normal, and adjust them
                                    in time if they need to be adjusted, so that the instrument always works in the
                                    best state; After use, finish, sweep or purge and turn off the instrument as
                                    required.</p>
                                <p>(2) The use of all equipment must be registered and the operating instructions
                                    need to be strictly followed. Prior to the experiment, the equipment should be
                                    inspected to ensure that it is functioning properly and to prevent equipment
                                    malfunction. During operation, the condition of the equipment should be
                                    monitored at all times to detect any abnormalities.</p>
                                <p>(3) The maintenance of the instrument is divided into regular maintenance and
                                    daily maintenance, and the purpose is to find out the hidden dangers of failure
                                    so as to take preventive measures in time. Scheduled maintenance is a complete
                                    maintenance of large equipment for a fixed period of time. Daily maintenance is
                                    the daily maintenance and inspection of instruments and equipment, including the
                                    spot check of each shift and the daily inspection.</p>
                                <p>(4) After the experiment, the equipment should be thoroughly cleaned and
                                    inspected to prevent the presence of residual harmful substances and bacteria.
                                </p>
                                <p><b>Reagent usage:</b> In order to achieve accurate experimental results, the
                                    following rules should be observed when taking reagents to ensure that the
                                    reagents are not contaminated and do not deteriorate:</p>
                                <p>(1) The reagent should not be touched by hand.</p>
                                <p>(2) Use a clean medicine spoon, graduated cylinder or dropper to take reagents
                                    and it is absolutely forbidden to use the same tool to take multiple reagents
                                    continuously. </p>
                                <p>(3) After the reagent is taken, the cork must be tightly closed, the cap and
                                    dropper should not be misplaced, and the bottle should be put back in place.</p>
                                <p>(4) The reagent that has been taken out cannot be put back into the original
                                    reagent bottle.</p>

                                <p>According to the definition provided by the European Committee for
                                    Standardization
                                    (CEN) in its Document No. 30 of 1992, cytotoxicity refers to cell death, cell
                                    lysis,
                                    and inhibition of cell growth caused by products, materials, and their
                                    leachates<sup>[3]</sup>.
                                    There exists a close interaction between the chassis cells and their loaded
                                    genetic
                                    circuits. Overexpression of genetic elements can trigger cellular growth

                                    while specific regulation of these elements can also lead to cytotoxicity. For
                                    genetic circuits, when chassis cells experience growth retardation due to growth
                                    stress or cytotoxicity, it adversely affects the predictability and genetic
                                    stability of the artificially constructed genetic circuits within them.

                                    Currently, the assessment of cytotoxicity often involves investigating two
                                    aspects:
                                    cell growth rate and survival rate<sup>[5]</sup>. However, there is a lack of a

                                <p>Growth rate serves as a direct indicator of cellular proliferation capacity. For
                                    many
                                    cell types, a decrease in growth rate is an early and sensitive sign of cellular
                                    damage or toxicity. However, survival rate is a crucial metric for assessing
                                    cellular health status and toxicity, as it directly reflects the ability of
                                    cells to
                                    maintain vital activities after exposure to genetic circuits. Given its

                                    importance over growth rate, survival rate is assigned a higher weight.</p>

                                    Tschirhart et al. investigated the growth rate of V. natriegens in various media
                                    and
                                    found that the doubling time of the control group under sucrose culture

                                    was 28.2±0.1 (min)<sup>[6]</sup>. After incorporating the designed genetic
                                    circuits, the growth
                                    of V. natriegens was simulated using the Michaelis-Menten Kinetic Model, with

                                    into Equation (1.2), Tg was calculated to be 90.78%.

                                    Colony-Forming Units (CFU) are commonly used to estimate the number of viable
                                    bacteria or fungi in a sample, serving as a measure of the proportion of cells

                                    maintain normal physiological functions under specific conditions. Conley et al.
                                    determined that the bacterial survival count for the wild-type V. natriegens
                                    carrying an empty vector after 5 days was 9.8×10<sup>5</sup>±1.1×10<sup>5</sup> CFU/ml, while the
                                    experimental group carrying the mtrCAB plasmid had a 5-day bacterial survival
                                    count
                                    of 6.3×10<sup>4</sup>±1.3×10<sup>4</sup> CFU/ml<sup>[7]</sup>. Substituting these values into Equation
                                    (1.3), Ts was
                                    calculated to be 93.57%.

                                    Compared to the chassis cells without loaded genetic circuits, the insertion of
                                    genetic elements inevitably introduced some toxicity (T<sub>total</sub> greater than 0).
                                    However, T<sub>total</sub> value was less than 1, indicating that the relative toxicity was
                                    within onefold of the control group, reflecting that the toxic effects were
                                    controlled within a relatively safe range. Upon reviewing the design of the
                                    genetic
                                    circuits, several aspects can be identified that contributed to reducing the
                                    toxicity to the chassis cells. Firstly, the entire system was designed as
                                    multiple
                                    relatively independent modules, each focusing on executing specific functions.
                                    This
                                    modular design minimized potential conflicts between different modules.
                                    Secondly,
                                    the genetic circuits incorporated various inducible promoters that initiate
                                    corresponding gene expression only under specific environmental conditions,
                                    helping
                                    to maintain a low metabolic state in non-target environments and thus avoiding
                                    the
                                    accumulation of cellular toxicity.

                                    We have found that previous iGEM teams have given little consideration to the

                                    however it is an unavoidable problem in synthetic biology. Our estimation of the

                                    environment;(2) preventing the leakage of engineered bacteria into the natural
                                    environment and causing contamination;(3) maximizing the protection of the users

                                <p>All luminescent bacteria use a similar system that oxidizes FMNH2 and long-chain
                                    aldehydes with oxygen and luciferase, emitting blue-green light at 490 nm. The
                                    luciferase enzyme has alpha (42 kDa) and beta (37 kDa) subunits, both needed for
                                    activity, and works best at 18°C but deactivates above 25°C. The lux genes
                                    (luxC, luxD, luxA, luxB, luxE) are expressed during bacterial growth, with LuxA
                                    and LuxB coding for the luciferase subunits, and LuxC, LuxD, LuxE coding for
                                    fatty acid reductase, acyltransferase, and ATP synthase, respectively. These
                                    form a complex that produces aldehydes for luminescence.</p>
                                <p>We have cultured Vibrio fischeri and found it has a slow growth rate and Quorum
                                    sensing-dependent luminescence, which is unsuitable for rapid search and rescue
                                    needs. Instead, we decided to chose Vibrio natriegens, the fastest-growing
                                    bacterium, as the chassis and planned to transfer genes for luciferase (luxA,
                                    luxB) and long-chain aldehyde reductase (luxC, luxD, luxE) into it.</p>
                                <p>In the ocean, the lack of a carbon source can largely limit the growth and
                                    luminescence of engineered bacteria. Through literature research, we have
                                    identified an engineered modified cyanobacterium that can photosynthesize and
                                    release sucrose, and has been shown to coexist better with and provide a carbon
                                    source for Vibrio natriegens.</p>
                                <p>However, the commonly used sump cyanobacterium PCC 7942 is not suitable for the
                                    high salinity environment of the ocean, and we chose another sump cyanobacterium
                                    PCC 7002 that is tolerant to high salinity.</p>

                                <p>The main component of LuminAid is an algal-bacterial system. It is crucial to
                                    ensure the safety of the product by maintaining the survival of the
                                    microorganisms and preventing any negative effects caused by their death. We
                                    have selected Vibrio natriegens and cyanobacterium, both of which are marine
                                    microorganisms, with the ability to survive in high osmotic environments and low
                                    temperatures. However, the low temperature of seawater may increase the content
                                    of ROS in Vibrio, which can be detrimental to its survival and function.
                                    Therefore, we need to enhance the cold tolerance of Vibrio natriegens to ensure
                                    its effectiveness.</p>
                                <p>Based on the coexistence of algae and bacteria, we utilized the sucrose produced
                                    by algae in an innovative way. Firstly, the sucrose serves as a carbon source,
                                    enabling the long-term survival of Vibrio natriegens. Secondly, we designed a
                                    gene circuit where the continuous supply of sucrose activates PsacB, leading
                                    Vibrio natriegens to express superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase, which
                                    break down ROS into water and oxygen, thereby preventing oxidative stress and
                                    conferring cold tolerance to Vibrio. The cold-tolerant Vibrio can also be used
                                    in spill containment.</p>

                                <p>Cyanobacterium can determine the source of sucrose for the sodium-demanding
                                    Vibrio, and its survival is equally important. As a member of the cyanobacterial

                                    products, we have selected the salt-tolerant strain PCC7002 to enhance its salt
                                    tolerance. In this way, the survival of microorganisms in our algae-bacteria

                                <p>There is the potential for leakage of our engineered bacteria in the ocean, and
                                    if leaked into the marine environment, we believe there would be two risks:</p>
                                <p><b>Risk of false positives:</b> uncontrolled growth of the engineered bacteria
                                    after leakage creates a fluorescent area that is too large and no longer helpful
                                    for accurate location determination.</p>
                                <p>
                                    <b>Risk of bacterial contamination:</b> Although Vibrio natriegens is of marine
                                    origin and is not pathogenic to humans, the leakage of engineered Vibrio
                                    natriegens has implications for the Earth's ecology and may cause some unknown
                                    ecological damage.
                                </p>
                                <p>In the ocean, traditional sterilization methods are no longer suitable because of
                                    the tedious steps required. Kill-switch circuit that have been widely used by
                                    previous researchers and iGEMers are considered preferred.The main body of the
                                    kill-switch circuit usually comprises two essential components: a sensor and a
                                    suicide effector. The sensor detects environmental changes that can activate the
                                    suicide effector thus inducing apoptosis.</p>
                                <p>We found that the methodology of the microbial survival module can also be used
                                    as part of the leakage prevention module. When Vibrio natriegens accidentally
                                    leaks out of the algal-bacterial coexistence system, the sucrose concentration
                                    around the bacteria decreases, and there is a lack of carbon supply to support
                                    survival. At the same time, the cold-tolerant module will also fail. Although
                                    Vibrio natriegens grows fast and survives well, the lack of cold-tolerance will
                                    also lead to the death of the engineered bacteria due to the accumulation of
                                    ROS.</p>
                                <p>We thought further about the leakage prevention module and concluded that the
                                    leakage prevention method relying on the microbial survival module is not
                                    active, after all, there may be other carbon sources supplied in the ocean, and
                                    the effect of the killing method of temperature-dependent ROS accumulation is
                                    not necessarily significant. We therefore designed active killing lines that can
                                    sense changes in sucrose concentration to secrete toxic proteins.</p>
                                <p>We designed two circuits for analysis. Firstly, for circuit 1 we used PSacB to
                                    sense sucrose concentration and set the deterrent protein lacI to control the
                                    expression of MazF toxin protein afterward. Circuit 1 decreases the secretion of
                                    lacI when the sucrose concentration decreases around the engineered bacteria,
                                    thus weakening the deterrence of Plac by lacI, which in turn expresses MazF to
                                    kill the bacteria. However, there is a problem that it may lead to false killing
                                    before our product is put into use, and the expression of PSacB was not found to
                                    be high in the Nanjing-China 2022 IGEM team. Of course line one has already
                                    realized the judgment of whether the engineered bacteria are out of the
                                    coexistence system based on the presence or absence of sucrose, and we then
                                    iterated on this basis.</p>
                                <div class="information mx-auto d-flex justify-content-center wi-lg-100">

                                <p>Circuit 2 was improved according to line 1's sucrose sensing, so that the
                                    engineered bacteria activated their sensing of sucrose only in the hypertonic
                                    environment of the ocean, and after entering the ocean, the spare sucrose in the
                                    product and the sucrose produced by the algae inhibited the deterrence of Pscr
                                    by ScrR, resulting in the expression of lacI and the non-expression of MazF.
                                    After the engineered bacteria were detached from the system, the sucrose
                                    concentration decreased, the deterrent effect of ScrR on Pscr was enhanced, the
                                    expression of lacI decreased, and MazF was then expressed to play a killing
                                    role.</p>

                                <p>In this way, our anti-leakage module was perfected. When leakage occurs, it can
                                    not only passively kill through the reverse side of the microbial survival
                                    module, but also actively kill by sensing the change of sucrose concentration,
                                    forming a comprehensive passive-active anti-leakage module.</p>

                                    that must be considered. In this regard, we have designed two recycling options
                                    for Luminaid:</p>

                                <p>Drug control system: We initially chose two commonly used inducers: arabinose and
                                    rhamnose, however, when comparing the properties of these two inducers we found
                                    that: rhamnose degrades slowly in the natural environment and may be present in
                                    the water column for long periods of time, causing potential bioaccumulation and
                                    environmental pollution. Rhamnose may have negative effects on aquatic
                                    organisms, especially microorganisms and aquatic plants. High concentrations of
                                    rhamnose may interfere with the physiology and ecosystem functions of aquatic
                                    organisms. Compared to rhamnose, arabinose is generally considered to have less
                                    or negligible impacts in the marine environment. Arabinose is a naturally
                                    occurring simple carbohydrate that can be utilized as a carbon source by many
                                    microorganisms and aquatic organisms. It is usually well biodegradable and can
                                    be rapidly broken down and utilized by microorganisms. It is a natural product
                                    that does not usually cause discomfort or toxic reactions in living organisms,
                                    is usually released in small amounts in the marine environment, and can be
                                    rapidly broken down by microorganisms in the water without causing long-term
                                    accumulation or contamination problems. Therefore, we believe that arabinose is
                                    a better choice. However, further experiments are still needed to prove whether
                                    the inducer can effectively kill engineering bacteria in seawater.</p>
                                <p>Temperature control system: suicide is triggered by heating the engineered
                                    bacteria to 37°C, inducing the expression of the toxin protein mazF. Limited by
                                    the specific heat capacity of seawater, the heating time may be longer, so the
                                    specific performance of this system needs to be further explored.</p>
                                <p>Option②: Recycle the engineered bacteria that have completed the task and re-make
                                    them
                                    into lyophilized bacterial powder. This is a more economical recycling method,
                                    but repeated freeze-drying will cause the engineering bacteria to lose their
                                    activity. In the future, we will test the effect of multiple
                                    freeze-drying-storage-recovery on the activity of the engineering bacteria, and
                                    calculate a reasonable number of times of recycling in order to ensure the
                                    quality of the product.</p>

                                <p>Exposure to radiation can lead to bacterial mutation or death. Ultraviolet
                                    radiation can cause DNA breakage, leading to the death of engineered bacteria
                                    and loss of their luminescent function. It can also cause mutation of functional
                                    genes, potentially resulting in the acquisition of genes related to virulence
                                    and drug resistance. Microgravity can weaken astronauts' immune systems, making
                                    it easier for bacteria to adhere to the human body and endanger the astronauts'
                                    health.</p>
                                <p>To counteract the damaging effects of UV radiation, it is important to protect
                                    the engineered bacteria to prevent infection from mutated pathogenic bacteria.
                                    The bacteria we have selected, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, can form large
                                    colonies and survive in space as aggregates, exhibiting resistance to
                                    environmental hazards such as UV radiation. Literature suggests that these
                                    colonies can survive on the ISS for 15 to 45 years.</p>
                                <p>In order to further improve the radiation resistance of the engineered bacteria,
                                    we envisioned to introduce RecO and RecF in radiation-resistant
                                    Chitinobacterium, and successfully verified in E.coli that the survival rate of
                                    the bacteria under UV irradiation increased after the introduction of RecO and
                                    RecF plasmids. From the physical isolation point of view, we designed special
                                    space suits containing radiation protection layer, which can simultaneously
                                    reduce the exposure risk of astronauts and engineered bacteria during

                                <p>Mars has a thin atmosphere and is farther from the Sun, so its surface
                                    temperature is much lower than Earth's. The average surface temperature on Mars
                                    is -46°C, and can drop to as low as -143°C at the poles in winter, and rise to
                                    about 35°C at the equator at noon in summer. Only cold-loving bacteria can
                                    survive at these extremely low temperatures. We discovered that Deinococcus
                                    radiodurans, which is resistant to radiation, stop growing when the temperature
                                    is lower than 4°C or higher than 45°C. Therefore, it's crucial to modify
                                    engineered bacteria to withstand the very low temperatures of Mars.</p>

                                <p>Team iGEM2010_Valencia/lea expressed an osmotic stress-regulated "antifreeze
                                    protein", the late embryogenesis-enriched LEA protein, which enables E. coli to
                                    resist cold shock. Changes in chemical potential and osmotic pressure when the
                                    bacteria are exposed to low or high temperatures result in the removal of liquid
                                    water from the cell, which activates LEA, causing the LEA protein to accumulate
                                    in nutrient tissues during osmotic stress, which in turn is involved in
                                    retaining water, preventing the aggregation of cellular proteins and the
                                    crystallization of other molecules during cellular desiccation, and stabilizing
                                    the cell membrane. The team selected the soybean PM2 (LEA3) protein and
                                    introduced it into E. coli to simulate cycling temperatures during a Martian
                                    solar day to compare E.coli survival. The results of the experiments showed that
                                    LEA was protective and synergistic with glycerol.</p>

                                <p>Team iGEM2023_Fudan heterologously expressed an antifreeze protein (AnAFP)
                                    derived from Ammopiptanthus nanus in Escherichia coli to promote its survival in
                                    sub-zero environments. AnAFP prevents macromolecules from solidifying by binding
                                    to or dissociating from calcium ions, and protects the stability of membrane
                                    structures under cold conditions by binding to or dissociating from membranes.
                                    The experimental results show that after 48 hours below freezing, the
                                    AnAFP-transformed E.coli showed significant freezing tolerance compared with
                                    normal E.coli.

                                <p>During the advancement of our project, we have consistently maintained attention to the social hotspots related to us.</p>
                                <p>Faced with the frequently occurring maritime accidents, which bring about substantial economic losses and heavy casualties, they constitute a severe reality that cannot be overlooked. These tragedies ruthlessly reveal a fact: maritime disasters are not distant concepts but can threaten the safety of us and those around us at any moment. Hence, in addition to conducting detailed statistical and in-depth cause analysis to draw lessons and take preventive measures, pre-event publicity, education, and popular science promotion also hold a pivotal position. We are deeply aware that in emergency situations, the correct handling methods and self-rescue knowledge can significantly enhance an individual's probability of survival. Therefore, when designing our products, apart from clearly introducing the product structure, usage methods, and product features in the product manual, we particularly intend to add a paper version of the "Maritime Self-Rescue Guide" in each product. Maybe in some emergency circumstances, we expect it to play a significant role.</p>

Japanese authorities, along with various departments, collaborated in the joint search effort, and a compassionate cargo ship came to assist. Ultimately, the citizen was successfully rescued."</i></p>

                                <p>To ensure the healthy development and widespread application of AI technology, the following suggestions are put forward:</p>
                                <p>Firstly, enhance the application of AI in risk assessment and prediction. Utilize AI technology to predict and evaluate potential risks in synthetic biology, such as off-target effects and ecological impacts in gene editing and new organism design, etc. Develop a risk warning system based on big data and machine learning, and monitor and analyze data in real time to issue early warnings for potential safety issues. Specific measures include building a risk assessment and prediction system, covering data collection (establishing a synthetic biology database), model development (using machine learning and other technologies), and warning mechanisms (promptly issuing warning signals and responding to them). </p>
                                <p>Secondly, enhance the role of AI in biological safety regulation. Utilize AI to assist regulatory agencies, improving the efficiency and accuracy of regulation, and building an intelligent biological safety management system to monitor biological samples and experimental processes comprehensively. Practical measures include building an intelligent regulatory system, including the development of regulatory platforms (to achieve remote monitoring and data analysis) and automated detection (using image recognition, etc.) as well as feedback mechanisms (to promptly address issues and ensure the effectiveness of regulation). </p>
                                <p>Third, promote the ethical integration of AI and synthetic biology. Pay attention to ethical issues in the development and application of AI, strengthen ethical education for researchers and the public, and promote healthy and sustainable development. Measures include ethics education and standard formulation, such as integrating ethics education into curriculum systems to enhance researchers' awareness, organizing experts to formulate standard norms, and promoting publicity and popularization through media and networks.</p>
                                <p>Fourth, promote international cooperation and standard setting. Strengthen international cooperation and exchange to address global challenges and promote the formulation of international standards. Measures include actively participating in exchanges to share achievements, jointly conducting research projects, and promoting the formulation of unified standards.</p>

                                <p>The characteristic of science and technology, which can pose a security threat while promoting the development of human society, has been referred to by academics as "dual-use". The concept of "dual-use technology" initially referred specifically to technologies that had both actual or potential military and civilian applications.</p>
                                <p>The U.S. Congress in the Defense Industry Technology Conversion, Reinvestment and Transition Act for the first time on the "dual-use technology" clearly defined: “dual-use technology” is related to products, services, standards, processing or procurement, can meet the military applications and non-military applications, respectively. A report by iGEM Team Bielefeld-CeBiTec 2015 also addresses the 2 sides of biotechnology. With this in mind, we assessed this project with a careful dual-use analysis.</p>

                                <h3>(1)Good biological adaptability</h3>
                                <p>The symbiotic system of Vibrio natriegens and Synechococcus has good biological adaptability. The ability of the symbiotic system to adapt to hypertonic cold seawater is improved by the cold-tolerant safety module, and at the same time, it can express antimicrobial substances to reduce the effect of bacteria in the ocean on wounds.</p>
                                <p>Using synthetic biology methods to introduce recO and recF into symbiotic system, an efficient DNA repair system is established in the cell, which can rapidly repair DNA molecules damaged by UV radiation and protect the integrity of the genome.</p>

                                <h3>(2)In-situ resource utilization</h3>
                                <p>①The symbiotic system can better adapt to extreme environments and cope with harsh environments such as coal mines, polar regions, and the deep sea.</p>
                                <p>②Provide the ability to utilize resources: use solar energy to produce sucrose, glow in emergency situations and provide help for rescue.</p>
                                
                                <h3>(3)Life Support</h3>
                                <p>①LuminAid aims to utilize synthetic biology to design a lifejacket with life-support functions to achieve resistance to low temperature, high temperature, acid and alkali, and high pressure to ensure that it can function in extreme environments.</p>
                                <p>②Algae-bacteria symbiotic systems are in extreme environments like space, processing, regulating and recycling air, water and solid waste to create a mini-ecosystem.</p>
                                <p>③Provide nutrients and assist in nutrient recyclin.</p>


                                
                                <h2 id="rrr3-2">2.Potential risks of the project</h2>
                                <h3>(1)Potential risks of chassis organisms</h3>
                                <p>The chassis organisms Vibrio natriegens and Synechococcus sp. PCC7002 have good stability and rarely have an abnormal increase in toxin genes. In addition to this, the inserts during the experiment do not confer characteristics that could cause harm to the chassis organisms. Based on the characteristics of the final product, it is expected that the project involves low potential risk.</p>
                                <p>All of our experiments are strictly limited to the laboratory and no organisms will be released in the natural environment.</p>

                                <h3>(2)Potential risks of information and technology </h3>
                                <p>There is a low risk of potential misuse of knowledge, information and technology regarding this project. All methods used in the project are basic molecular biology techniques such as plasmid extraction, RNA extraction, agarose gel electrophoresis. Digital tools widely used for genetic circuit construction were applied and specifications were followed during the design of the circuits to ensure that there would be no harmful consequences of enhanced toxicity. The project is not developing any new technology that could be of concern for large scale illegal use.</p>
                                
                                <h3>(3)Potential risks of possible misuse</h3>
                                <p>Every coin has two sides. Our engineered bacteria could be used maliciously for genetic coding by people trying to disrupt recombinant DNA technology. In this regard, we will strictly limit the genetic mapping of our engineered bacteria to prevent tampering by unscrupulous people. At the same time, we keep a detailed record of who uses the engineered bacteria, when, and for what purpose, to ensure that controls are in place.</p>

                                <p>Radiation sources such as cosmic rays and solar wind exist in space, and for good radiation protection, we introduced recO and recF genes into the engineered bacteria for UV radiation damage resistance. UV-resistant engineering bacteria may have the ability to survive after leakage in space compared to chassis bacteria that have not been introduced with radiation-resistant genes. For this reason, we introduced a comprehensive passive-active anti-leakage module, which is capable of not only passive killing by the reverse side of the microbial survival module, but also active killing by sensing changes in sucrose concentration.</p>
                                <p>A sucrose dilution suicide switch was designed. Upon the leakage of the engineered bacteria from the biofilm, the sucrose concentration is reduced. Subsequently, the engineered bacteria that had leaked outside the biofilm expressed MazF, which resulted in the bacteria committing suicide. Additionally, the absence of a carbon source is a contributing factor in bacterial death. When combined with the active expression of the toxin protein MazF, this constitutes a reliable strategy to prevent bacterial leakage. Furthermore, we selected drug-controlled and temperature-controlled termination switches to guarantee the active eradication of the engineered bacteria, thus preventing potential leakage and associated complications. In addition to this, it is of equal importance to prevent the release of engineered bacteria into the environment in the context of space exploration. Our protection strategies are equally applicable in this domain and we believe it to be an effective measure in avoiding potential biosecurity issues.</p>

                                <h3>(2)Standardized use and effective supervision</h3>
                                <p>In addition to the basic biosafety measures before entering the lab, the lab personnel also record the procedure of each operation to ensure that all experimental operations are standardized and follow the rules of the BSL2 lab. In addition, our PI has been monitoring our progress to ensure that none of the sequences used in this project are dangerous or pose any risk of misuse.</p>


                            
                                <h2 id="rrr3-4">4.Risks and Benefits Comparison</h2>
                                <p>The benefits of this project outweigh the risks associated with the development of the project. In addition, given the strict compliance of the LuminAid project, the potential for misuse of the technology is low. In summary, we can conclude that this project makes a useful attempt to rescue in extreme environments, especially in space and contributes to the technological development of human society with no serious security threats.</p>
